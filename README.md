**HaxeFlixel-Tiled tmx map testing**

----------
This is a simple test for loading maps created using [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) on HaxeFlixel. I was working on a game and find out that Flixel does'nt support tmx maps. Later I found a git repository which contained HaxeFlixelTiled library and the result is this demo project.

But then when I run the project I get an error saying "Unknown TMX map format"? I did'nt know what I did wrong and this fried by brain too much and even tried to modify the actual Fliexl tiled loader ;)! Later on 'HaxePunk forum' someone mentioned this problem about this and he even solved it. What I actually did was, I forgot to add nmml reference to the tmx map!

Hope you can get something from this tmx demo....
